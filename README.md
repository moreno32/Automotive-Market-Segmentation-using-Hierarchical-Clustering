# Automotive Market Segmentation using Hierarchical Clustering

## 🔄 Overview:
In this project, we aim to classify the most distinctive vehicle groups for the creation of new concepts for an automobile manufacturer. By using clustering methods such as Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, we will analyze and summarize existing vehicles in the market to help the manufacturer determine which existing vehicles are most similar to the new prototypes. This information will assist the manufacturer in making informed decisions about the supply of new models.

## 🎊 Motivation:
The automobile industry is constantly evolving, with new models and concepts being introduced regularly. In order to remain competitive, it's crucial for manufacturers to understand the market and their competition. By using data analysis and clustering techniques, we can provide a comprehensive overview of the existing vehicle market and help the manufacturer determine the best strategy for introducing new models.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1)	Understanding of hierarchical clustering algorithms
2)	Data cleaning and feature selection techniques
3)	Normalization and data transformation
4)	Implementing clustering algorithms in python using scikit-learn and scipy libraries
5)	Visualization of results to communicate insights effectively

## ⚙️ Technical Aspects:
The project utilizes python libraries.

## 🧰 Technology used:
The project will use piplite, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy, and itertools.

## 📚 Data Source:
The data source for this project is the cars_clus.csv file, which contains information on existing vehicles in the market.

## 🗂️ Project Structure:
The project will consist of the following stages.
1)	Data import and cleaning
2)	Feature selection and normalization
3)	Clustering using Scipy and scikit-learn
4)	Results visualization and interpretation

## 👥 Credits:
This project was made possible with the support of IBM. The team set out to classify the most distinctive vehicle groups for an automobile manufacturer. Using advanced clustering techniques such as Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, the team analyzed and summarized existing vehicles in the market to provide valuable insights for the manufacturer. These insights will aid the manufacturer in making informed decisions about the supply of new vehicle models, and bring their new concepts to life.
